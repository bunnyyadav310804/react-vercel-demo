The flaw is making an absolute claim without sufficient evidence.' },

What assumption does this conclusion rely on?', options: ['Remote work is only beneficial for tech companies', 'That the sample from tech companies represents all professions equally', 'That productivity can be measured in percentage terms', 'That remote work was previously uncommon'], correctIndex: 1, explanation: 'The author generalizes from a limited sample. This assumes tech sectors represent all industries, which may not be true.' },

Most appropriate response?', options: ['Violent crime is serious here', 'The headline is misleading due to small absolute numbers', 'Crime rates always involve large percentages', 'Statistics cannot be verified'], correctIndex: 1, explanation: 'While 300% is technically correct, 2 to 8 cases is tiny.

Minimum standard this should meet?', options: ['One person felt better', 'Multiple controlled studies with statistical significance', 'Company belief it works', 'Medical professionals recommend'], correctIndex: 1, explanation: '"Clinically proven" means multiple controlled studies with statistical significance.

Maybe SP is Rs. 25 per dozen? Then SP = 2 × 25 = 50. Loss = 80 - 50 = 30. Still not matching. Let me assume SP Rs. 50/dozen: SP = 100. Profit = 100 - 80 = 20. Still not.
